## Instructions

Write a playwright automation (https://playwright.dev/) in TypeScript that navigates to amazon.com and searches for the 3 following items:

nvidia 3060 </br>
nvidia 3070 </br>
nvidia 3080

It should find the 3 best prices (shown on the first page only) for each of the searches, and save the item, url, and current date to a csv file.

## How to use it!

From the root directory type:

```sh
npm run test
```

The csv files will be saved to the root directory.
